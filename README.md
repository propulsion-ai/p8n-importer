## Features
- **Multiple Format Support**: Easily import datasets in formats like VOC, YOLO, and Label Studio.
- **Direct Upload**: Upload datasets directly to the PropulsionAI platform with an easy-to-use command-line interface.
- **Flexibility**: Extendable to support additional dataset formats in the future.
- **Secure API Key Handling**: API keys are handled securely via environment variables or interactive input.
- **Verbose Logging**: Get detailed logs of the import process with the `--verbose` option.
- **Visualization**: Preview the dataset conversion result before uploading with the `--visualize` option.

## Installation
To install `p8n-importer`, you need Python 3.x and pip installed on your system. You can install `p8n-importer` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install p8n-importer
```

## Usage
`p8n-importer` is designed to be user-friendly and can be executed from the command line. Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

```bash
p8n-importer [format] [source_folder] [--verbose] [--visualize]
```

- `[format]`: The format of your dataset (e.g., `voc`, `yolo`).
- `[source_folder]`: Path to the source dataset folder.
- `--verbose` (optional): Enable verbose logging for detailed information during the import process.
- `--visualize` (optional): Visualize the dataset conversion result before uploading.

### Visualization Feature
When using the --visualize flag, you can preview how the dataset will look after conversion. This feature is particularly useful to verify annotations and dataset integrity before uploading it to the PropulsionAI platform.

### API Key and Dataset ID
The tool will prompt you for the API key and dataset ID. The API key can also be set as an environment variable `PROPULSIONAI_API_KEY`.

## Supported Formats
Currently, `p8n-importer` supports the following formats:
- VOC (Visual Object Classes)
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- Label Studio

More formats are planned for future releases.
